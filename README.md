# xCurling
xG for curling.

Dependencies: scikit-learn, opencv, matplotlib

xCurling uses data about curling stone positions and attempted shots to build a model in order to attempt to predict the average accuracy of a given attempt. The data is processed using sklearn, with a number of possible models. OpenCV is used to analyze still overhead frames of curling sheets to facilitate data entry. Data can be visualized using pyplot.
